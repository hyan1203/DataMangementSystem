How to use the system
=====================
This draft webpage is pretty simple.

The index.html is the main basic page which shows all basic components like header, navigation bar, images etc.

There are three fundamental scripts:
* main.js: Control the display of the certain page according to the click in navigation area
* login.js: Control the connection to the database when the user tries to login
* register.js: Control the connection to the database when a new user wants to register for a new account
